              Korea, Gou returned to England to study at the London College of
              Fashion. During this time, she also honed her skills in music
              production, a hobby she had started in her younger years. Upon
              moving to Berlin, Gou made her official debut in 2016 with the EPs

              landed gigs at some of the worldâ€™s most iconic venues, becoming
              the first Korean DJ to perform at the legendary Berlin nightclub
              Berghain. She has also shared the stage with renowned artists such
              as DJ Koze, Moodymann, The Blessed Madonna, and secured spots at
              festivals like Coachella, Glastonbury, and Primavera Sound. In
              2018, Peggy Gou released the EP <i>Once</i> via Ninja Tune
              Records, followed by the DJ mix album{" "}
              <i>DJ-Kicks: Peggy Gou</i> (2019), released by !K7 Records. In
              addition to receiving rave reviews, the album marked her first
              appearance on the Billboard chart, peaking at number 9. Heavily
              inspired by 90s dance music, the single <q>I Go</q> was released
